Student Mental Health Check Bot

Welcome to the Student Mental Health Check Bot project.
This is a simple, beginner-friendly Python program designed to help students pause for a moment, check in with their emotions, and receive gentle, supportive guidance. It also serves as a great introductory project for students learning basic Python concepts.

About This Project

Starting college can bring a mix of excitement, stress, uncertainty, and new responsibilities. This bot was created to offer a small but meaningful check-in — a space for students to reflect on how they’re feeling without judgment.

Although it is not a replacement for professional mental health support, the bot aims to provide comfort, encouragement, and simple suggestions that promote self-care.

What the Bot Does

The bot interacts with the user through a short and calm conversation. It:

Greets the user in a friendly and understanding tone

Asks how they are feeling from a list of common emotions

Responds with thoughtful, supportive messages

Offers optional self-care tips based on the user’s choice

The intention is to make the interaction feel human, warm, and relatable.

What You Will Learn

This project is ideal for first-semester students or anyone new to programming. By exploring the code, you will practice:

Working with functions

Handling user input

Using conditional statements

Writing clean and organized code

It demonstrates how even simple programming techniques can create something meaningful.

How to Run the Program

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome. You can expand the bot with more responses, add new features, or explore different interface options.

Final Note

This project shows that you don’t need advanced tools to create something thoughtful. A few lines of code can encourage reflection, start conversations, and make someone feel a little less alone.
Thank you for taking the time to explore this project.
